## Introduction to Version Control Systems
A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers manage changes to source code over time.  
It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project, keep track of every modification, and revert to previous versions if needed.

There are two main types of version control systems:

- **Centralized VCS (CVCS):**  
  A single central server stores all the versioned files, and users check in/out changes.  
  Example: Subversion (SVN)

- **Distributed VCS (DVCS):**  
  Every user has a full copy of the repository, including its entire history.  
  This makes collaboration faster and safer.  
  Example: **Git**

> 💡 Version control is essential for team collaboration, safe experimentation, and maintaining the integrity of project history.

## History of Git
Git was created in 2005 by **Linus Torvalds**, the creator of Linux.  
It was developed in response to issues with the proprietary version control system **BitKeeper**, which was being used by the Linux kernel development team.

When access to BitKeeper was revoked, the open-source community needed a new, fast, and reliable distributed version control system. Linus had specific goals in mind:

- High performance  
- Strong support for **non-linear development** (thousands of parallel branches)  
- Fully distributed architecture  
- Data integrity

Within just **a few weeks**, the first version of Git was released.  
Since then, it has become the **most widely used version control system** in the world — powering everything from open-source projects to enterprise software.
