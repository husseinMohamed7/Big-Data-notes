# 🐧 Linux for Data Engineers

## 🕰️ Historical Timeline

### 🧠 1. Foundations (1948–1960s)
- **1948** – *Information Theory* introduced by Claude Shannon. It changed how we think about data, storage, and communication.
- **1957** – *Sputnik* launched by the USSR → U.S. created **ARPA** (later **DARPA**) to push technology forward.
- **1960s** – *NASA* and *ARPA* funded research in computing and networks.

### 🖥️ 2. Time-Sharing Systems (1960s)
- **1961** – *CTSS (Compatible Time Sharing System)* by MIT: first OS to allow multiple users at once.
- **1965** – *GE 645* computer supported CTSS with terminals.
- **TTY (Teletypewriter)**: Early input/output device to communicate with mainframes.

### 💻 3. From MULTICS to UNIX (1965–1970s)
- **1965** – *MULTICS* project started: a complex OS made by MIT, Bell Labs, and GE.
- **1969** – *UNICS* (later UNIX) created by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs.
- **1972** – UNIX rewritten in **C language** (also developed at Bell Labs): made it portable and modular.

### 🎓 4. Education & MINIX (1987)
- **1987** – *MINIX* created by **Andrew S. Tanenbaum** for teaching OS concepts. It was UNIX-like but limited.

### 🧑‍💻 5. Free Software & GNU (1983–1990s)
- **1983** – **Richard Stallman** announced the *GNU Project*: goal was to build a free UNIX-like OS.
- **1985** – Founded the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**.
- **1989** – Released the first version of the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.
- GNU included tools like `gcc`, `bash`, `make`, but it lacked a working kernel.

### 🐧 6. Linux is Born (1991–Today)
- **1991** – **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish student, created the **Linux kernel**.
  - He released it under the GPL license so it could work with GNU tools → complete OS = **GNU/Linux**.
- **1993+** – Distributions like *Slackware*, *Debian*, *Red Hat* began combining GNU + Linux + package managers.
- **2005** – Linus created **Git** to manage the development of the Linux kernel.

## 💡 Why This Matters for Data Engineers

- **Linux** powers most data infrastructure: Hadoop clusters, Spark jobs, cloud servers, Docker containers.
- Understanding Linux helps you:
  - Use command-line tools efficiently.
  - Manage resources and debug issues.
  - Automate workflows with shell scripting.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- **UNIX** was the foundation. **Linux** is the free, open-source alternative.
- Linux is built with the **UNIX philosophy**: "Do one thing and do it well."
- GNU tools + Linux kernel = modern **GNU/Linux** system.
- Git was created to manage Linux itself — and now powers the software world.
